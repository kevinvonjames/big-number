Used code from https://github.com/lukeleppan/better-word-count for word count, char count, sentence count, and page count

Box 1 is on top, etc

currently you have to make an edit for the numbers to initialize on a fresh startup

pro tip: use command + shift + p to open the command palette and type copy file path to copy the file path of the current file to use for custom note path

you can add .md at the end of the file path or not, it will work either way
